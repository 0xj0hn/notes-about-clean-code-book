# Meaningful names
The thing is important in this Chapter is that we'd better make the code cleaner as much as it could be.

## Example:
~~int d = 0; //elapsed time in days~~

## Insead of this, just try:
`int elapsedTimeInDays = 0;`

Isn't it much better than the first one? Even if we comment on the line we cannot get much of it.
Because it doesn't lead to get the intent(purpose) of it.
It sould be intention-revealing in this context.

## What's the purpose of this code?
```
public List<int[]> getThem() {
List<int[]> list1 = new ArrayList<int[]>();
for (int[] x : theList){
    if (x[0] == 4)
        list1.add(x);
    return list1;
}
```
Why is this hard to tell what it is doing? Since it doesn't reveal the intent, we cannot observe anything about the code.

the problem is not simplicity but implicity. Say that we're implementing a simple board game.
we find that the board is a list of cells called theList.
## Let's rename that to gameBoard:
```
public List<int[]> getFlaggedCells() {
List<int[]> flaggedCells = new ArrayList<int[]>();
for (int[] cell : gameBoard){
    if (cell[STATUS_VALUE] == FLAGGED)
        flaggedCells.add(cell);
    return flaggedCells;
}
```
*Notice that the simplicity of the code hasn't changed! Just the implicity has changed here. but the code become much more explicit.*
Let's say we're going further and write a simple class called 'Cell' to represent the cells instead of an array of ints.

```
public List<Cell> getFlaggedCells() {
List<Cell> flaggedCells = new ArrayList<Cell>();
for (Cell cell : gameBoard){
    if (cell.isFlagged())
        flaggedCells.add(cell);
    return flaggedCells;
}
```
*With these simple name changes, it's not difficult to understand what's going on.*

# **Avoid Disinformation**
Programmers must avoid leaving false clues that obscure the meaning of code. We should
avoid words whose entrenched meanings vary from our intended meaning. For example,
`hp`, `aix`, and `sco` would be poor variable names because they are the names of Unix plat-
forms or variants. Even if you are coding a hypotenuse and hp looks like a good abbrevia-
tion, it could be disinformative.
Do not refer to a grouping of accounts as an `accountList` unless it’s actually a List.
The word list means something speciﬁc to programmers. If the container holding the
accounts is not actually a `List`, it may lead to false conclusions. So `accountGroup` or
`bunchOfAccounts` or just plain accounts would be better.
